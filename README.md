# stayhydratedTwitchBot

A Twitch bot that helps you to stay hydrated while streaming

**Why 120 mL an hour?** \
Assuming the average human is awake for 16 hours a day and needs to consume approximately 2 Liters of that delicious hydrogen oxide. If you were to divide 2 liter by 16 hours you would get 125 mL of water an hour, but because I like the number 120 more then 125, you have to consume 120 mL of water an hour.
